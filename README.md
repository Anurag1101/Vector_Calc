**Vector Calculator*

**Description**:

This is a simple vector calculator implemented in Python. It allows users to perform basic vector operations, including vector addition, dot product, and cross product. The program prompts users to input the components of vectors and outputs the results of the operations.

**Features**:

**Vector Addition**:  Add two vectors and get the resultant vector.

D**ot Product:**  Calculate the dot product of two vectors.

**Cross Product:**  Compute the cross product of two vectors.

**Code Overview**:

The main components of the code include:

**Vector Class:**

    Initializes a vector with x, y, and z components.

    Implements vector addition, dot product, and cross product operations.

    Provides a string representation of the vector in i,j,k form.

**Input Function:**

Prompts users to enter the components of a vector.

Returns a Vector object based on user input.

**Main Program Logic:**

Accepts input for three vectors from the user.

Displays the results of the vector operations (addition, dot product, and cross product).

**How to Use**:

**Clone the repository to your local machine:**  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Vector_Calc.git

**Navigate to the project directory:**  cd Vector_Calc

**Run the program:**  python vector_calculator.py

Follow the prompts to input the vector components and view the results of the operations.

**Example Output**

**Input first vector:**

**Enter x component:**  1

**Enter y component:**  2

**Enter z component:**  3

**Input second vector:**

**Enter x component**: 4

**Addition:**  Vector(5i + 7j + 9k)

**Dot Product:**  32

**Cross Product:**  Vector(-3i + 6j + -3k)

**Addition:**  Vector(8i + 10j + 12k)

**Dot Product:**  50

**Cross Product:**  Vector(-6i + 12j + -6k)
